# Student-Marks-System
Student Marks System does basic operations on the data of students using files.
Data structure used is hash table using linked list.  I have used this data structure because it is easy to travel the data when it is in the form of table. My single linked list table supports to travel a student’s marks and also a subject’s marks in one direction. I have produced a hah key value for each word to make searching of the word easier when necessary.
In functions like retrieving a subject’s marks is fast using the table as we can move though the marks without travelling  much. My algorithm searches the subject name using key and then goes to that position and directly accesses the marks of every student.
The data from the file is retrieved and stored in memory and all the manipulations are done on memory as it is easier than travelling the file again and again.
